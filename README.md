# Mesh
Mesh is a secure, peer-to-peer (p2p), open source instant messenger designed to provide end-to-end encryption. Primary aim of developing this instant messenger is to provide privacy which is achieved using strong cryptography. It can be used over Internet and private LAN networks for instant messaging and file transfer. 

Mesh is based on Bit Chat and is its successor. Mesh takes major core ideas from its predecessor and removes a few. Notably, Mesh does not require centralized user registration and provides anonymous profiles based on Tor hidden services. It also removes using BitTorrent trackers for finding peers which was causing issues with Bit Chat due to some ISPs blocking BitTorrent traffic would block Bit Chat traffic too. Instead, Mesh relies only on DHT for all purposes.

The architecture is designed keeping in mind the security principle that everybody is secure or no one is. There is no meta data generated when you use Mesh. Since, there is no user registration, we dont know who uses Mesh or how many people use it.

Mesh is still under development and the website redirects to bitchat.im for now.
